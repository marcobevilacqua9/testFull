## Questions

1. _Which part are you most proud of?_
    I'm not very proud of this project. I have experience in java back end development so it was easier and 
    faster to develop the java server.
2. _Where did you spend more time? What was the most difficult?_
    I spent most of the time on the react.js part since I've never programmed in this language and I have little 
    experience in web development.
3. _How did you find the test overall? Did you have issues or difficulties completing it?_
    I felt like the react.js part took too much time to complete. I took me about 5 hours to complete both parts of 
    the test, and Dockerfile part and automated test parts are still missing. Also clicking on the history 
    does not search for the pokemon and the gui looks bad (no style). 
    I think overall the difficulty of this test is correct.
